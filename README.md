===============

This is the source HTML and CSS for the Denver Post twitter listing page at [denverpost.com/twitter](http://www.denverpost.com/twitter).

To update the live Twitter page
-----

Just copy the content of twitterpage.html, make the changes you need, and paste the results into freeform 18709030 in NGPS.

To remove someone, find their three-line block (on img, one a and one p) and remove it.

To add someone, copy a three-line block and fill in the new user's info. Be sure to put it under the right category.

Image locations are acquired by visiting the user's twitter.com page, right clicking on their avatar and choosing "Copy image location" or "Copy image URL." Paste the results into their block.

To make someone Featured, simply copy their three-line block into a 'featured' block, and move someone else's out. Be aware that 'featured' blocks can have about twice as many words in their paragraph (p tag).

Spotlight works the same as Featured, but can have about 4x as many words in the paragraph (p tag).
